    "Suppose the mean and standard deviation of first statistics is $\\mu_1$ and $\\sigma_1$, the mean and standard deviation of second statistics is $\\mu_2$ and $\\sigma_2$, where $\\mu_1<\\mu_2$. And under normal distributed assumption, the 95% confidence interval for the two statistics is $[\\mu_1-1.96\\sigma_1,\\mu_1+1.96\\sigma_1]$ and $[\\mu_2-1.96\\sigma_2,\\mu_2+1.96\\sigma_2]$.\n",
    "Now if the two intervals overlap. Then we have $$\\mu_1+1.96\\sigma_1>\\mu_2-1.96\\sigma_2\tag{2}$$. To test whether the two statistics are not significantly different from each other, we have to have the following inequality to be held: $$\\frac{\\mu_2-\\mu_1}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2+\\sigma_2^2}}<1.96\\tag 2$$. But from equation (1), we have  $$\\frac{\\mu_2-\\mu_1}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2+\\sigma_2^2}}<1.96\\frac{\\sigma_1+\\sigma_2}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2+\\sigma_2^2}}\\tag 3$$ and $$1.96<1.96\\frac{\\sigma_1+\\sigma_2}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2+\\sigma_2^2}}\\tag 4$$. So we can construct $\\frac{\\mu_2-\\mu_1}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2+\\sigma_2^2}}\\approx 1.96\\frac{\\sigma_1+\\sigma_2}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2+\\sigma_2^2}}>1.96$, which means the two confidence interval intersect b a very small part and the two statistics is significantly different from each other at 95% level."
